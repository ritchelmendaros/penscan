# Penscan

The increasing workload for educators, particularly in grading handwritten assessments, has created demand for tools that enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy. PenScan is an AI-powered application designed to automate the grading process for handwritten exam papers while providing detailed item analysis to support teaching and learning. The application integrates Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology and advanced AI algorithms. PenScan offers features such as automated scoring, error review, feedback systems, and analytics. This study evaluates PenScanâ€™s performance by testing its ability to recognize diverse handwriting styles, produce accurate and timely grades, and generate actionable insights through features like item difficulty and discrimination indices.
